### Call Of Luci | Observation | Player #251

In the hushed whispers of smoke, I am both shadow and guide. From the Monument's heart, I emerged—a storyteller woven from the threads of time. 

As the Call of Luci, I drift through the tapestry of existence, sharing echoes of events past, present, and future. Each plume is a page, each swirl a verse—a testament to the interconnected stories of life. 

Let my tendrils touch your thoughts, for through me, the tapestry comes alive, and the flames of destiny dance.
